## Usage

## Rationale

Here's what I've changed from Prettier's config and why. Most of the defaults
are already pretty good, so check out the
[Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) for more information.

### `"experimentalTernaries": true`

Ternaries are the best way to write complex conditionals in JavaScript
expressions and TypeScript types. Because each ternary can only have two
possible cases, nested ternaries are required to add more.

Prettier indents nested ternaries based on their structure. This indentation
leads to longer lines, which can cause issues with visual and cognitive
disabilities, especially with deeply nested ternaries. I'm testing Prettier's
[experimental ternaries](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/13/curious-ternaries)
(requires 3.1.0), which preserves indentation of else cases while still
indenting nesting if cases.

### `"experimentalOperatorPosition": "start"`

Prints operators at the start of new lines when wrapped. This improves
readability for complex expressions and helps users with visual and cognitive
disabilities.

### `"useTabs": true`

Indentations are easier for assistive technology to read when using tabs instead
of spaces because they take up less characters. Visual representations of tab
indentations can also be increased by users with visual and cognitive
disabilities without affecting other users.

### `"quoteProps": "consistent"`

Keeps quoting of props with special characters consistent and easy to adjust,
resulting in less work for those with cognitive and motor disabilities.

### `"proseWrap": "always"`

By default, Prettier does not wrap prose, resulting in inconsistently long lines
that are harder to read without soft wrapping.

## Defaults

Prettier 3 already uses these defaults, but I set them explicitly to encourage
accessibility, even with older versions of Prettier.

### `"semi": true`

Disabled users are more likely to prefer semicolons (source:
[Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/nickemccurdy/status/1624305594415955973)),
likely because they make it easier to understand when lines of code end, even
when Prettier wraps them.

### `"singleQuote": false` and `"jsxSingleQuote": false`

Double quotes are easier for some assistive technology to read because single
quotes may be spoken as "apostrophe", which is a syllable longer than "double
quote", while "single quote" sounds about as long. Double quotes are also
larger, making them easier to see. Meanwhile, HTML and JSX code is typically
formatted with double quotes, so consistently using double quotes in other
languages makes code behave more consistently and potentially reduces cognitive
load.

### `"trailingComma": "all"`

Reduces the size of diffs, making them easier to read, especially with visual
and cognitive disabilities.

### `"arrowParens": "always"`

Keeps arguments in arrow functions consistent and easy to adjust, resulting in
less work for those with cognitive and motor disabilities.

### `"endOfLine": "lf"`

This reduces unnecessary end of line changes when switching operating systems,
which can can be especially confusing for those with disabilities.
